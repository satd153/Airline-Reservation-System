A simple project on airline reservation system using python..
The Airline Reservation System project aims to develop a comprehensive and efficient web-based application that facilitates the process of airline ticket booking and management. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for passengers to search for flights, make reservations, and manage their bookings. It will also offer administrative functionalities for airline staff to manage flight schedules, seat availability, and customer data.

Key Features:

Flight Search and Booking: Passengers can search for flights based on their preferred dates, destinations, and travel preferences. The system will display available flights along with relevant details such as departure/arrival times, durations, and prices. Once a suitable flight is found, passengers can proceed to book their tickets by providing passenger information and making payment.

User Registration and Profile Management: Users can create accounts within the system to store their personal information and booking history. They can manage their profiles, including updating contact details, preferences, and viewing past and upcoming bookings.

Seat Selection: Passengers will have the option to select their seats during the booking process. The system will display the available seats on a graphical seat map, allowing users to choose seats according to their preferences and requirements.

Multiple Payment Options: The system will support various payment methods such as credit cards, debit cards, and online payment gateways, providing a secure and convenient payment process for users.

Flight Schedule Management: Airline staff will have access to an administrative interface to manage flight schedules. They can add new flights, update departure/arrival times, assign aircraft, and make necessary changes to accommodate operational requirements.

Booking Management: The administrative interface will enable airline staff to manage and modify customer bookings. They can handle booking cancellations, reschedule flights, process refunds, and handle special requests made by passengers.

Notifications and Reminders: The system will send automated notifications and reminders to passengers regarding their bookings, flight changes, or cancellations. This feature will help keep passengers informed and minimize any inconvenience caused by unforeseen circumstances.

Overall, the Airline Reservation System project aims to provide a streamlined and convenient platform for both passengers and airline staff, enhancing the efficiency of flight booking and management processes while ensuring a seamless user experience.
